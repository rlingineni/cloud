# OpenT2T-Api
API for interfacing with OpenT2T

Simple OPENT2T Rest API that is in the works.

You can currently go to /register/wink and pass in the parameters to get what you would need for onboarding a Wink device. You will need to put in a client secret and stuff in onboarding.js though. Code is pretty self-explanatory
